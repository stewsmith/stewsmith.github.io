I'm using this blog as a place for my thoughts -- about Computer Science, Math, or anything interesting I come across.  The
primary motivation for starting this blog is for my own learning.  Teaching and explaining ideas is one of the best ways to learn.

Maybe you'll find something interesting here.  If you do, feel free to start a conversation with me about it.
