You're interested in Programming and Computer Science, and you
want to see if it's really for you.  Here are some
resources to give you a taste of how cool programming can be.

[Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/)
<br>
Your best place to start.  It helps if you use IOS or Linux
but it tells you how to get started with Windows too.
I've found it isn't great for problem solving but it
helps you learn syntax quickly.  As soon as you learn syntax,
move on to the other two links.

[Coding Bat](http://codingbat.com/python)
<br>
Short challenges that are mostly problem solving.  These can be done in browser.  Problem solving is the fun part of computer science.
You may need to learn some syntax before you do these.  There are syntax lessons in this site if you get stuck.

[Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net/problems)
<br>
Just problems, no bullshit.<br>
They don't even give you answers,
they just tell you if you got the problem right.
This is my absolute favorite, and really got me into programming.

Learning to code takes a tremendous amount of effort.  You
will get discouraged and frustrated.  Try and remember
that frustration is part of the learning.
