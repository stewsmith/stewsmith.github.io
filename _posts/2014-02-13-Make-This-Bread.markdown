This is the easiest bread recipe that I've ever seen. It makes delicious bread. Friends and family will be impressed with you. They
may even think you finally have your life together.

Warning: This recipe takes about 12-18 hours for the dough to rise.

    <li>3 cups All-Purpose Flour</li>
    <li><sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></sub></sup> teaspoon instant yeast</li>
    <li>1 <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></sub></sup> teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>1 <sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub></sub></sup> cups water </li>
</ul>

DIRECTIONS:
<ol>
    <li>Put flour, yeast, and salt in a large bowl. Stir.</li>
    <li>Add the water. Stir.</li>
    <li>Cover with plastic and let sit for 12-18 hours.</li>
    <li>Using pinches of more flour, fold and knead bread.</li>
    <li>Let bread rise for 2 hours.</li>

I modified this recipe from [Mark Bittman's No-Knead Bread Recipe](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html?_r=0).
