The following are tools and tips that you can use to be a better software writing intern.


Notebook
-----------
Are you really going to remember that obscure command a week from now? The answer is no. Get a notebook (I prefer unlined)
and write down anything new to you. That way you can ask your team members when you really need help, instead of bugging
them for the syntax for restarting the server.


Chatroom for interns
-----------
Office chat rooms are intimidating. If you’re like me, you are probably trying not to bad
in front of your co-workers. You won’t ask all the questions you really should in the chatroom for fear
of having documented proof of your idiocy. When you make an intern chat room, you can ask questions freely, and
bond with your fellow interns. If one doesn’t exist already, go ahead and create one!


Online dotfiles
-----------
It would be super cool if you showed up on your first day and was able to start working with your new computer with ease.
If you store your dotfiles online then it’s super easy. Check out
[this guide](http://blog.smalleycreative.com/tutorials/using-git-and-github-to-manage-your-dotfiles/) to make it happen.


Learn grep
-----------
You’ll be dealing with projects larger than you’ve ever seen in school and you’ll have to quickly navigate
through lots of files. Grep was made for searching through files. Learn the basic flags and be comfortable with it
and you’ll be cruising and searching through code. Consider making an alias for grep commands with flags, as they
can get pretty long and gnarly.


Know your Version Control
-----------
Learn whatever version control your team uses. This is how they collaborate, and you want to be in on that. Branching
is especially important when collaborating. Knowing merging and rebasing are corollaries to understanding branching.
