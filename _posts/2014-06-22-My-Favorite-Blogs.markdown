Steve Yegge was an engineer at Amazon and Google and writes software engineering and career advice posts. My favorites include:
[The Five Essential Phone-Screen Questions](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/five-essential-phone-screen-questions),
[Get that job at Google](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html),
and
[Ten Tips for a Slightly Less Awful Resume](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/09/ten-tips-for-slightly-less-awful-resume.html)

[Derek Sivers](http://sivers.org/)
-----------
Derek Sivers is a programmer/buinessman who is now a rich dude with lots of smart things to say. This is a post
on [Kurt Vonnegut's storytelling ideas](http://sivers.org/drama).
He also [takes notes](http://sivers.org/book) on books that he reads.

[Math ∩ Programming](http://jeremykun.com/)
-----------
This blog is all about cool, creative math. It has everything from graph coloring to Turing machines to probability theory.
If you don't have exposure to a subject, Math ∩ Programming also has a series of fantastic [primers](http://jeremykun.com/primers/)
on a series of topics.

[Unschooled](http://unschooled.org/)
-----------
Nicholas Bergson-Shilcock is one of the founders of Hacker School. I particularly like his piece
["The Most Beatiful Ideas I've Encountered"](http://unschooled.org/2011/11/the-most-beautiful-ideas-ive-encountered/).

[Philip J. Guo](http://pgbovine.net/)
-----------
Thoughtful Writings about programming with an academic slant. Check out these posts on
[tech privilege](http://pgbovine.net/tech-privilege.htm),
[interviewing tips](http://pgbovine.net/programming-interview-tips.htm),
and [productivity tips](http://pgbovine.net/productivity-tips.htm).

[Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/)
-----------
The AI guy. His post ["Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years"](http://norvig.com/21-days.html) is a classic.
Another great one is ["Solving Every Sudoku Puzzle"](http://norvig.com/sudoku.html)
