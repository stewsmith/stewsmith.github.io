I don't like sites like Codecademy and Code School because they coddle you
too much. There's actual science behind what I mean when I say coddle.
The experiment
[Comprehension and Recall of Sentences](http://web.stanford.edu/~gbower/1969/comprehension_recall_sentences.pdf)
was performed at Stanford in 1969 by Bobrow and Bower.

Here's the gist of the study:

<h1>Control Group:</h1>

> **Experimenter**: "Remember the pair Cow-Ball"
>
> **Subject**: "Okay"
>
> *Months pass*
>
> **Experimenter**: "When I say Cow, you say..."
>
> **Subject**: "I dunno. Forgot."


<h1>Experimental Group:</h1>

> **Experimenter**: "Remember the pair Cow-Ball. Make up a sentence to remember it."
>
> **Subject**: "Okay. The Cow plays with a Ball."
>
> *Months pass*
>
> **Experimenter**: "When I say Cow, you say..."
>
> **Subject**: "Ball."
>
> **Experimenter**: "Nice Bro"


<h1>Yoked* Group:</h1>

> **Experimenter**: "Remember the pair Cow-Ball. A sentence to help you remember it is:
> 'The Cow plays with a Ball.'"
>
> **Subject**: "Okay."
>
> *Months pass*
>
> **Experimenter**: "When I say Cow, you say..."
>
> **Subject**: "Can't recall."

The Experimental Group used more mental effort than the other groups.
So the lesson here is that **the harder you think about a problem, the better you learn it.**
So the next time you are reading a book and skipping the exercises, remind yourself that
you'll learn it better if you put in some mental hustle.


*Yoked means paired to a response from the Experimental Group.
